      <b>I kept my focus</b> on learning from many platforms such as Udemy and
      YouTube. And then apply those knowledge i acquired with hands-on projects.
      You can view it in <span class="cyan-text bold">Projects</span> or in my
      Github Repository.

    <p>
      <b>Back then</b>, i didn't have a clear interest that truly captivated me
      and it wasn't until i discovered programming that everything i learned
      started to <span class="cyan-text bold">"click"</span>. But still, i was
      skeptical about whether this was the right path for me, but as time went
      by i became increasingly convinced that it was a good fit.

    </div>
    <p>
      <b>What i love</b>
      most about programming is that i can see the progress of what i am
      building. Seeing the lines of code transform into a functional application
      is just satisfying.
